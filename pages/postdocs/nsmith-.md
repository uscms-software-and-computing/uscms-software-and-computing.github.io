project_title: Object Storage for CMS in the HL-LHC era
project_goal: >
    Demonstrate feasability of using Ceph object store technology to store and retrieve CMS event data products at a finer granularity than file-level.
    Benchmark storage usage and analysis access performance and compare to traditional file-level storage solutions.
mentors:
  - Bo Jayatilaka (Fermilab)
  - David Mason (Fermilab)
