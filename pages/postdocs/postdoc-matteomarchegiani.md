    <b>2025 Q3 </b>
    <br>

    *   Progress
        *   Learned how to train the GNN employing GravConv layers in combination with the object condensation loss for the reconstruction of energy clusters in the HGCAL
        *   Studied the performance and energy resolution of the GNN-based reconstruction in zero-pileup environments, considering simulated photons, pions and tau leptons
        *   Ported the training datasets production to CMSSW_15_1_X, making use of the FineCalo simulation
