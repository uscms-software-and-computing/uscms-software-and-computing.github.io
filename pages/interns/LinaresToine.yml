"My name is Antonio Linares, I studied Physics at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia.
During my bachelor’s degree I realized I enjoy Computer Science, so after graduation I took
my career to follow that path. My desire towards learning more about computer systems
while staying in direct touch with Physics motivated me to be an intern as a Tier 0
Operator for CMS at Fermilab. Ever since I started the internship, I have learned a lot about
computing. To put it in perspective, allow me to describe the job.
During data taking, the LHC produces 8 to 10 GB of data per second. This massive rate puts a lot
of pressure on the resources available, since all data must be saved, reconstructed, and then
sent to several desired destinations. The main issue during saving the data is the storage: at 10
GB/s, any technical or availability problem with the disk or tape resources may result in loss of
data. To keep up with the high data taking rate, Tier 0 must generate all the output data in a
timely manner to allow the deletion of the LHC data. This is done through reconstruction
workflows with the use of thousands of computers at CERN. Again, any technical issue that
arises through the reconstruction of data will keep the input data from being deleted and
potentially risking storage for new data. All the output data is processed again to generate more
compressed files of the data and allow their distribution to desired destinations.
Tier 0 is then a job consisting heavily of operations such as monitoring the performance of the
computer resources, the progress of the reconstructing workflows, the available storage, the
data taking rates, among other things. Also, testing of new software for the data reconstruction
is often necessary during data taking, which also concerns Tier 0. Finally, when everything is
running smoothly or no data is being taken, Tier 0 focuses on developing tools to facilitate their
tasks. All of this means that a Tier 0 Operator ends up understanding the roots of how the CMS
system is set up. This translates into massive computing knowledge."
